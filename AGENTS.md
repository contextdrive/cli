# contextdrive-cli

This repository is `ctx`, the ContextDrive command-line client. v1 commands are `ctx login`, `ctx ingest`, and `ctx status`. `ctx` is Java, a GraalVM native image, and it does not link DuckDB or Tika. The sample on `main` is not the template for login, ingest, or status.

The client walks, hashes, and uploads. It does not parse, embed, run SQL, or decide policy. It asks `server` for a file row and a short-lived upload grant, writes bytes straight to R2, and commits. Embedding and parse run in `server` after the commit. This client does not accept a customer bucket.

## Vision repository

Product vision, architecture, and decisions live in the private repository `contextdrive/vision`, on branch `main`. Read `PRODUCT_VISION.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` there before designing or implementing. This repository does not keep a product vision. Do not add one. The upload contract is `ARCHITECTURE.md`: a pending file row, then an upload grant for that key, then a commit. Customer-owned buckets are out. If a note in this repository disagrees with the vision repository, the vision repository wins.

Reach `contextdrive/vision` in this order:

1. Local sibling checkout. From this repository root, `../vision` is the vision repository when the repos share a parent folder. Use that checkout only when it exists and `git -C ../vision rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` prints `main`. Any other branch is not the source of truth.
2. Remote `main`, with the `gh` CLI. The logged-in token is the credential. The repository is private.

```shell
gh api repos/contextdrive/vision/contents/PRODUCT_VISION.md?ref=main --jq .content | base64 -d
gh api repos/contextdrive/vision/contents/ARCHITECTURE.md?ref=main --jq .content | base64 -d
```

`gh repo clone contextdrive/vision` and checking out `main` is the same remote read.

## Local instructions

Read `LOCAL.md` at this repository root when it exists. The file is optional and gitignored. It instructs agents about this machine only: local paths, local tools, and workflows that stay on this computer. Follow it for work in this checkout. Another checkout has its own file, or none. Create `LOCAL.md` only when asked. Leave its contents out of committed files, issues, and pull requests. Product behavior stays in `contextdrive/vision` on `main`. That repository’s `AGENTS.md` records the convention.

## Packages

The sample on `main` is `io.contextdrive.GreetingCommand`. Real commands live in `io.contextdrive.cli`. Each GitHub issue in this repository is one command. Do not take on server work (storage SPI, parsers, workers, policy) in a CLI change.
